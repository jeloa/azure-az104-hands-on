# Lab 09b – Implement Azure Container Instances

## Lab Introduction
In this lab, you learn how to deploy and test Azure Container Instances (ACI) using a Docker image. Azure Container Instances provides a fast and simple way to run containers in the cloud without managing servers or virtual machines.

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes  
**Region:** East US (or nearest available)

## Lab Scenario
Your organization has a web application running on a virtual machine in an on-premises data center. The organization plans to migrate applications to the cloud while minimizing infrastructure management overhead. Azure Container Instances and Docker are evaluated as a serverless container solution.

---

## Job Skills
- Deploy a container using Azure Container Instances
- Configure container networking
- Verify container deployment and logs

---

## Task 1: Deploy an Azure Container Instance Using a Docker Image

Azure Container Instances was used to deploy a simple web application from a public Docker image.

### Container Instance Configuration

- Resource group: az104-rg9
- Container name: az104-c1
- Region: East US
- Image source: Quickstart images
- Image: `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest`
- Operating system: Linux

### Networking Settings

- DNS name label: *globally unique*
- Public access: Enabled (port 80)

> The container is publicly accessible using the following format:  
> `http://<dns-name>.<region>.azurecontainer.io`

Monitoring logs were disabled to reduce overhead for this lab.

After reviewing the configuration, the container instance was successfully deployed.

## Task 2: Test and Verify Deployment of the Azure Container Instance

Once deployment completed, the container instance was validated.

### Verification Steps

- Container status confirmed as **Running**
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) copied from the Overview blade
- Application accessed via browser using the container FQDN

The following page was successfully displayed:



The page was refreshed multiple times to generate HTTP request logs.

---

## Viewing Container Logs

Container logs were reviewed to confirm application activity.

### Log Verification

- Navigated to: **Containers > Logs**
- Verified HTTP GET request entries generated by browser access

This confirmed that the container was receiving and responding to web requests as expected.

## Key Takeaways
- Azure Container Instances (ACI) allows you to run containers without managing servers
- ACI supports both Linux and Windows containers
- Containers can be deployed quickly using public Docker images
- ACI is ideal for short-lived, event-driven, or burst workloads
- Built-in logging helps validate container behavior
