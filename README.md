# Azure AZ-104 Hands-On Labs  
**Microsoft Azure Administrator – Practical Learning Repository**

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on labs completed as part of my learning journey toward the **Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104)** role. The goal of this project is to build practical experience using the Azure Portal by deploying, configuring, monitoring, and securing Azure resources following real-world administrative and operational scenarios.

All labs were performed in a live Azure environment and documented to reinforce understanding of core Azure administration concepts.

---

## Learning Objectives
Through these labs, I focused on developing foundational skills in:

- Azure identity and access management
- Resource governance and lifecycle management
- Networking and connectivity
- Compute, storage, and platform services
- Monitoring, logging, and operational visibility
- Security-aware administration using native Azure tools

---


Each weekly folder includes:
- A `README.md` explaining objectives and outcomes
- Individual lab documentation files
- Screenshots for validation and reference
