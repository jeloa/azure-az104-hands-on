# Week 2: Resource Lifecycle Management & Operational Efficiency

## 1. Project Overview
- This module focused on the operational discipline required to manage cloud resources effectively throughout their lifecycle. The objective was to implement best practices for resource organization, movement, and decommissioning, ensuring governance and cost efficiency.

##2. Operational Rationale

- Effective resource management is crucial for both security and cost control in an enterprise environment. This lab focused on:
- Cost Management (FinOps): Ensuring resources are tagged correctly and deleted when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary spend.
- Security Posture: Organizing resources logically to apply granular security policies (RBAC and Azure Policy) efficiently.
- Auditability: Using resource locks and proper naming conventions to ensure compliance and prevent accidental data loss.


## Performance Metrics

- Cost Efficiency: Maintained a zero-cost cloud environment by adhering to strict decommissioning schedules post-lab validation.
- Compliance: Achieved 100% adherence to required tagging policies.
- Operational Resilience: Verified that resource locks successfully prevented unauthorized deletion actions.
